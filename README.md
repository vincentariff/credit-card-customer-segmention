## Introduction

* In this preject we segment credit card customers into different groups to help identify patterns as to apply specific business strategies per group.

* We explored the data, visualized feature trends and their correlations with the target variable, applied one-hot encoding, scaled the data, determined the optimal number of clusters using an elbow curve, built the clustering model, and analyzed the results for each cluster.

* Example result:
  
  Cluster 1 
  * Characteristics: Spend the most; Most tansactions; High credit limit; Mostly men
  * Insight: People (majority men) with high income, credit limits, and a lot of transactions. Could receive benefits to spend even more money.

## Dataset
